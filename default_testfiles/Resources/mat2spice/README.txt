IN THIS DIRECTORY:
==================

A) mat2spice.m
--------------

This file contains the full Mat2spice program written by Jorg Daniels.  It does not depend on any other Matlab files except for the standard Matlab functions.

B) docs
-------

This directory contains the file mat2spice2.html, which was generated by Mat2spice.  It contains the full documentation of the program and can be displayed using a web browser.

It also contains the source files mat2spice2.m2html, toc.m2s and toc_helper.m2s, which were used to generate the file HTML.  You do not need these files if you will not change the documentation.  However, the HTML file links to them as examples of Mat2spice code.

The file m2s_run.m is an intermediate file generated by Mat2spice.  It is not very informative and it will be reproduced or overwritten every time Mat2spice is run on the input files (as will the HTML file).  This file is also linked to by the HTML file as an example.

C) bus
------

This directory contains two possible implementations of a BUS function for use with Mat2spice's short bus syntax.  The simplest one is called "bus" (which is required for using the short bus syntax).  The other one is more flexible and is called "xbus" so both functions can be used together without naming conflict.  If you want to use the flexible function with the short bus syntax, it has to be renamed to "bus".

Both functions depend on the mat2str2 function, which is included in the directory.
